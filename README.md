# Randomizzer - Spin the Wheel
<span>- Let the wheel decide your fortune</span>

## Introduction
Randomizzer is a simple web application created for fun.
It has a 'Spin Wheel' feature where you can add or remove items from the list and it will randomly select anyone on each spin. If you can't decide between two or more things, let the wheel decide it for you. This could be useful for making quick decisions or just playing simple games among your peers.

> Have fun!
